title: "Evaluating DINOv2 for Left Atrium Segmentation from MRI Images"
excerpt: "Accurate left atrium segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and planning treatments for atrial fibrillation. We evaluated the out-of-the-box performance of DINOv2, a self-supervised vision transformer, for segmenting the left atrium from MRI images. With a mean Dice score of 87.1%, DINOv2 outperformed baseline models, demonstrating its robustness even with limited data and minimal fine-tuning. This highlights DINOv2â€™s potential for broader applications in medical imaging.
