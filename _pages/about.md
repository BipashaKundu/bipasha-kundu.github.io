I am a 3rd- year Ph.D. student in Imaging Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. I currently hold a part-time Research Assistant position at Biomedical Modeling,Visualization and Image-guided Navigation (BiMVisIGN) Lab. My current research interest focuses on Medical Image Analysis using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. I completed my Master's in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota Duluth, MN, USA and my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh.
