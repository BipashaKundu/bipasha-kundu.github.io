excerpt: 'Accurate left atrium (LA) segmentation from pre-operative scans is crucial for diagnosing atrial fibrillation, treatment planning, and supporting surgical interventions. While deep learning models are key in medical image segmentation, they often require extensive manually annotated data. Foundation models trained on larger datasets have reduced this dependency, enhancing generalizability and robustness through transfer learning. We explore DINOv2, a self-supervised learning vision transformer trained on natural images, for LA segmentation using MRI. The challenges for LA's complex anatomy, thin boundaries, and limited annotated data make accurate segmentation difficult before & during the image-guided intervention. We demonstrate DINOv2's ability to provide accurate & consistent segmentation, achieving a mean Dice score of .871 & a Jaccard Index of .792 for end-to-end fine-tuning. Through few-shot learning across various data sizes & patient counts, DINOv2 consistently outperforms baseline models. These results suggest that DINOv2 effectively adapts to MRI with limited data, highlighting its potential as a competitive tool for segmentation & encouraging broader use in medical imaging.'
